tic-tac-toe-minimax
A collection of minimax algorithms for tic-tac-toe, implementation in Python. Includes simple minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and fixed-depth search with heuristic evaluation.

Usage
Each program can be run from the command line without modification (just run python file_name.py). Some programs include an argument parser that can change parameters like search depth and move-order.
